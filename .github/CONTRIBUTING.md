# Contribution Guidelines


## Goals of this List
* Quality over quantity, i.e. do not add every single framework under the sun
* The frameworks should have a certain maturity and popularity
* Do not add projects that don't have an issue tracker or version control


## Contributing

* Fork the repository
* Add your suggestion
  * Use the template below
  * Choose the appropriate category
  * Sorting should be done roughly by numbers of stars (or importance)
* Create a pull request

```
- [**TODO**](TODO) - TODO.  
  ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/TODO/TODO.svg?style=social&label=Star)
  [Demo](TODO),
  [Docs](TODO),
  [Repo](TODO)
```

Note that there are two whitespaces after the first line to enforce a line break.

Adding links to the demo or documentation is optional, but you should add them if they are explicitly provided by the framework.
